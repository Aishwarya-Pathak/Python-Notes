#If block is not a loop it is a condition
## : and indentation is very important here. Indentation is like a replacement to the brackets we have for other languages
#
# greeting = "Good Morning"
# if greeting == "Good morning":
#     print("It's morning")
#     print("line 2")
# else:
#     print("Some issue occurred")
#     print("Test data")
#
# print("if.. else.. block learnt ") #Not a part of the if.. else.. block
#
# a = 4
# if a > 2:
#     print("4 is greater than 2")
# else:
#     print("test data")
#
# Output:
# Some issue occurred
# Test data
# if.. else.. block learnt
# 4 is greater than 2

##for loop in python

#we'll take a list
values = [1, 2, 3, 5]
# #iterate through each value in the list and print it
# for x in values: # here x is variable which will iterate through each n every value in the list
#     print(x)
#
# Output:
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 5

#print multiples of the values in the list
# for x in values:
#     print(x*2)

#print sum of first 5 natural numbers 1+2+3+4+5
# result = 0
# for x in range(1, 6): ##iterate from 1 to 5 i.e range(i,j) >> it will iterate from i to j-1
#     result = result+x
# print(result)
#Output:
15

#print sum after two indexes (pass index)
# for x in range(1,10,2): #for every loop jump two indexes
#     print(x)
#
# Output:
# 1
# 3
# 5
# 7
# 9

#u can skip the first arg, it will it it by default 1 and when printed it will start from 0 till m-1
# for m in range(10):
#     print(m)
#
# Output:
# 0
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4
# 5
# 6
# 7
# 8
# 9
