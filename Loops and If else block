#If block is not a loop it is a condition
## : and indentation is very important here. Indentation is like a replacement to the brackets we have for other languages

greeting = "Good Morning"
if greeting == "Good morning":
    print("It's morning")
    print("line 2")
else:
    print("Some issue occurred")
    print("Test data")

print("if.. else.. block learnt ") #Not a part of the if.. else.. block

a = 4
if a > 2:
    print("4 is greater than 2")
else:
    print("test data")
    
Output:
Some issue occurred
Test data
if.. else.. block learnt 
4 is greater than 2

##for loop in python

#we'll take a list
# values = [1, 2, 3, 5]
# #iterate through each value in the list and print it
# for x in values:
#     print(x)
#     
# Output:
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 5
