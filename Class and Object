# ##program for summation of two numbers:
# 
# class TestClass:
#     num = 10
#     def __init__(self,a,b):
#         self.number1 = a
#         self.number2 = b
# 
#     def add(self):
#         print("The summation is: {}".format(self.number1+self.number2+TestClass.num))
# 
# obj1 = TestClass(4,6)
# obj2 = TestClass(7,8)
# obj1.add()
# obj2.add()
# 
# Output:
# The summation is: 20
# The summation is: 25
