# # Class >>             Blueprint of a car (what all properties will the car possess)
# # Object >>            Cars
# # Methods/Functions >> Manufacturers of the car (what all functions/actions will the car perform,etc etc)
# # Self keyword is mandatory for calling the variables
# # self should be mentioned mandatorily in the methods when declared in the class
# # Below, a and b in the constructor are dummy arguements catching the values send while creating the object of the class
# # self.number1 and self.number2 are instance variables. After the values are caught by a and b they are assigned to these instance variables
# # These instance variables are then used in the methods
# # Functions are called as methods when declared in the class
# # num is a class variable. If you want to use it in any method, you can use this way >> ClassName.class_variable for eg >> TestClass.num

# ##program for summation of two numbers:
# 
# class TestClass:
#     num = 10
#     def __init__(self,a,b):
#         self.number1 = a
#         self.number2 = b
# 
#     def add(self):
#         print("The summation is: {}".format(self.number1+self.number2+TestClass.num))
# 
# obj1 = TestClass(4,6)
# obj2 = TestClass(7,8)
# obj1.add()
# obj2.add()
# 
# Output:
# The summation is: 20
# The summation is: 25
