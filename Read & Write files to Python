# Create object of the open method
# When u open the file, you have to close it as well using close()

# print(file.read()) # if u run the file at this moment nothing will be printed coz the file read all the content but we
# need to see all the content in the output so we added print in front of it
# Read method will give all the values.
# If I want to read only 1st 2/3 values then

#print n number of characters by passing parameter
#print(file.read(2)) #>> will give 1st 2 characters from the file. if we give 5 it will read upto 5 characters

# read file line by line
# print(file.readline()) # >> read first line of that txt file
# print(file.readline()) # >> will read the next line
# print(file.readline()) # will read next line

# while line != '': #while the line is not equal to blank
#     print(line)
#     line = file.readline()
# # loop will continue till it finds a blank value in the text

# print(file.readlines())
 #and print all values in the list
